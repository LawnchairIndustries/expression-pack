# Expression Pack
> A collection of chinese memes / reaction images

To expand the collection simply place more jpg files in the root of the repository and run `process.py`. The order/number of a specific meme is not guaranteed.

## Access this as an "API"

Query /meta on the GitHub pages hosted instance to get the number of images. You can now request all the images from the /img endpoint, they are all .jpg files and start at 0.

## Todo

- Resize all images to the same size for easier use as a data source for e.g. random profile pictures
- Collect more images
